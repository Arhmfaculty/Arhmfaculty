# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Maxwell

I'm a dual-focused technologist with a passion for **machine learning research** and **offensive cybersecurity**. Iâ€™m currently building and contributing to projects in both areas â€” from LLM reproducibility and bias evaluation, to honeypot deployment, password cracking, and fraud detection.

Whether Iâ€™m reverse engineering attacker behavior or debugging transformer architectures, my goal is to make AI and security systems more transparent, robust, and ethical.
