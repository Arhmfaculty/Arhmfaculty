# 👋 Hi there, I'm Maxwell

I'm a dual-focused technologist with a passion for **machine learning research** and **offensive cybersecurity**. I’m currently building and contributing to projects in both areas — from LLM reproducibility and bias evaluation, to honeypot deployment, password cracking, and fraud detection.

Whether I’m reverse engineering attacker behavior or debugging transformer architectures, my goal is to make AI and security systems more transparent, robust, and ethical.

### 🧠 Machine Learning & AI Interests

-  Fairness & bias mitigation in large language models (LLMs)
-  Mathematical reasoning using transformers
-  Reproducible deep learning pipelines
-  Building LLMs and optimizers from scratch in PyTorch

---

### 🛡️ Cybersecurity Focus Areas

-  Penetration testing (Web app, network, and auth bypass)
-  Honeypots & threat simulation (Cowrie, log analysis)
-  Contactless Payment Security Authentication
-  AI/ML for security: fraud detection, anomaly detection

### 🔨 Notable Projects

####  AI/LLM Projects
- `llm-from-scratch` – Transformers built in pure PyTorch with educational annotations
- `llm-fairness-evaluation` – Measuring demographic bias in LLM output responses
- `llm-paper-reproduction` – Reproducing foundational LLM papers like BERT and GPT
- `llm-math-reasoning` – Prompting LLMs for symbolic and arithmetic logic

####  Security Projects
- `cowrie-honeypot-analysis` – Dockerized SSH honeypot for monitoring attacker behavior (log parsing & TTP extraction)
- `password-cracking-john` – Cracking shadow/MD5 hashes using JtR with custom and incremental modes
- `port-scanner-cli` – Lightweight Python-based TCP port scanner using sockets and IP validation
- `ml-fraud-detection` – Real-time bank transaction fraud detection using ADASYN sampling and supervised learning

###  Current Learning Journey

✅ HuggingFace Transformers & prompt engineering
✅ SIEM basics & Splunk integration with honeypots
✅ Bias metrics in AI (toxicity, fairness, sentiment)
✅ Hands-on labs with Burp Suite, SQLi, XSS, and log forensics
